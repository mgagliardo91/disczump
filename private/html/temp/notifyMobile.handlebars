<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4em; color: #008eed; font-weight: bold">disc|zump mobile has arrived!</div>
<p>We have been working hard to bring the disc|zump dashboard to your mobile devices. With the current release, you can now view and manage your dashboard as well as explore other users and their inventories, all from your phone's browser. While some features remain only accessible from a desktop browser, we will be bringing more functionality to the mobile platform in the near future.</p>
<p>Exciting things are coming! We are continuing to work on new features and functionality to increase usability and bring you the best. Our fully-functional mobile app will be released in the upcoming months, providing you with a clean and easy-to-use dashboard for when you're on the go.</p>
<p><b>Remember!</b> Feedback only makes the site better. Feel free to submit and concerns, bugs or recommendations using the Feedback dropdown in the desktop version of the dashboard or contact us at <a href="mailto:support@disczump.com">support@disczump.com</a>.</p>
